# 1. Abstract

This LIP contains guidelines for organizing events inside the lab's spaces.


# 2. Specification

## 2.1. What does the lab provide to events?

1. The lab can provide just its rooms and some chairs on scheduled date and time.
2. The lab can provide some equipment that is available. Usually there is a projector, video camera, mic, WiFi and other equipment that may be used for events, but the lab can not guarantee that they will be available, or they will work. It is the event organizers responsibility to ensure the equipment for their events.
3. Since the lab is run by volunteers in their free time, the lab can not promise any commitment on behalf of its members for doing any task whatsoever. It is the event organizers responsibility to do their own work and to attract volunteers.

## 2.2. Event Calendar

The event calendar is the place where all events must be registered.

The calendar is at <https://trello.com/b/GHda069L/hackafe>.

## 2.3. Actors

### 2.3.1. Event Organizer

An event organizer is the person or the organization organizing an event. They may be lab members as well as external people/organizations/companies.

#### Event Organizers Responsibilities:

1. The organizers must arrange one or more members with keys to be their event hosts (see 3.1.3. Event host). At least one event host is required.
2. The organizers must send their hosts the following info:
	- Event:
		- name
		- picture (size at least 700x700 px)
		- website
		- description
		- date and time slot
		- lecturers, facilitators
		- audience type
		- ticket price
	- Organizer
		- name
		- logo in vector format
		- website
		- contact info (person, email, phone)
3. The event organizers reserve room, date and time for the events on first-come-first-reserved basis. Once a room and date-time slot are reserved for an event, another event must not take them. It can be done only if the organizer of the first event gives his consent to change their reservation.
3. The organizer holds the responsibility for keeping the property in the lab and taking care the event attendees follow the lab's rules.
4. It is organizers responsibility before the event:
	- to promote the event and attract attendees
	- to check the equipment they will use, learn how it works and have a plan B in case something does not work
	- to clean and arrange the rooms they will use
5. If an event is noisy, with a lot of attendants or something else that may disturb the lab's environment, the event organizers must conform with the already planned events and notify the members with a post in the forum.
6. Immediately after the event the organizer must:
	- clean the rooms and wash the dishes they used
	- gather the chairs and the equipment they used
7. The organizers must send general statistics to their host no later than 2 working days after the finish of the event with the following info:
	- number of participants
	- other achievements

### 2.3.2. Lab Member with Keys

A lab member with keys is a member who is entrusted by the community with keys for the lab.

The volunteer members with keys are not obliged to become host for any event. Everyone decide on themselves.

### 2.3.3. Event Host

An event host is a lab member with keys who already agreed to host an event.

#### Event Host Responsibilities:

1. The event host must add/update/remove the event details and reserved date-time slot in the calendar.
2. The host of a given event should be in the lab during:
	- preparations before that event
	- holding the event
	- cleaning and putting the rooms in order after the event
3. The host must present the lab to the audience at the beginning of the event
4. The host must send the statistics to the lab's executive body.
5. An event host may withdraw from hosting at any time. If there are no other hosts for this event, then the last one must remove the reservation.

If there are many hosts for a given event, they can split their responsibilities.


## 2.4. Finance

Free events do not pay a room fee.

Paid events pay a room fee according to the table below:

|                          | Event hall    | Main hall   |
| ------------------------ |:-------------:| -----------:|
| **up to 2 hours**        |   30 BGN/hour | 30 BGN/hour |
| **2+ hours**             |   27 BGN/hour | 37 BGN/hour |
| **in non-working hours** |         + 20% |             |

The main hall is not available for events in the standard working hours.


## 2.5. Workflow

**Step 0: Find a date and a host**

The organizer has to find both a free date-time slot and an event host available in the same slot.

The date-time slots can be checked in the lab's calendar published at the lab's website, <http://www.hackafe.org>.

The organizer should ask the members with keys to become their event host either personally or by posting a request to all of them in the forum in the Events category, <http://frm.hackafe.org/c/events>.


**Step 1: Make a reservation**

The organizer sends the required info to their host. Then the host adds the event in the calendar.

For paid events the organizers must pay the fee no later than 3 days before the start of the event.


**Step 2: Hold the event**

**Step 3: Follow-up**

The organizer must send general statistics to their host.


# 3. Rationale

The mechanism for holding events in the lab is intended to be as light as possible. The organizers do their work on their own without taking it upon lab members except if they themselves are interested in helping a given event.
Also there is no single member overloaded with tasks to carry out for all events.

Reception of a lot of people in the lab relies extremely on trust.
The most important criteria for allowing organizers to hold an event in the lab is their integrity. Since the members with keys are the most trusted in the community and the most frequent users of the lab, the community relies on their discretion for organizers integrity.

As well as they are volunteers so they do not have any obligation to host an event. That is why it is the organizers' responsibility to ask the members with keys to be in the lab while the event is held.

Naturally there are events that are not interesting for any member with keys and most probably their organizers will not find available member with keys to host them. So if the organizers would like to hold events in the lab in the future, then they have to become members, contribute significantly to the community and earn its trust so the community may raise them to members with keys.
